# webscrape-challenge

In this challenge, we will be scraping data and information related to NASA's Mars exploration from the following sites:
1. https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html
2. https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html

In the first part of this exercise (python script can be found in file titled part_1_mars_news.ipynb) all news titles and preview descriptions are captured in a dictionary

In the second part of this exercise (python script can be found in the file titled part_2_mars_weather.ipynb) weather data collected by the Curiosity rover is analyzed. This data is then converted to a data frame which is then exported to a csv file titled mars_weather.csv found in the "Output" folder
